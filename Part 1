Part 1: SDG Selection and Problem Definition

SDG Selection:

    SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure

Problem Definition:

    A specific problem within SDG 9 could be limited access to real-time climate data and infrastructure monitoring in remote areas due to insufficient satellite technology.
    Proposed Solution: Use micro-satellites to provide affordable, real-time data for infrastructure monitoring (bridges, roads, etc.), and environmental monitoring (climate, pollution levels).
